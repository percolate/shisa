## Overview

Percolate's Enterprise API Gateway Platform.

This project provides a platform for building API Gateway services
within your organization.  We understand that each enterprise has
unique challenges to consider when introducing as an API Gateway and
one size does not fit all.  To accommodate that this project allows
you to tailor the functionality to suit your environment.  A minimally
customized service can created quickly and rich options for advanced
configuration offer adaptability for most environments.

The project has these high-level goals:

- Configurability
- Robustness
- Speed
